I am Yiqian Wu (Âê¥Â•ïË∞¶), a fourth-year CS Ph.D. candidate at the [State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University, where I have been conducting research under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaogang Jin](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin) since 2021. From May 2024 to April 2025, I was an academic guest at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), collaborating with Prof. [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html). I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Chu Kochen College at Zhejiang University in 2021.

I love painting!  I have posted some of my paintings on my [website](https://onethousandwu.com/artgallery/), and also shared some videos on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/6414209). I hope you will enjoy them too :)


## My Journey: Advancing 2D to 3D Avatar Generation

My current research focuses on portrait editing and generation. I have proposed two portrait image editing methods based on 2D GAN models, developed a dataset and designed a new architecture for 3D-aware face GANs. Currently, I am utilizing diffusion models for text-guided 3D avatar generation and extending this approach to enable animatability.

Below is an overview that showcases all of my papers through a single identity!
