<b>Abstract:</b>

We present Multi-feature Radiance-Predicting Neural Networks (MRPNN), a practical framework with a lightweight feature fusion neural network for rendering high-order scattered radiance of participating media in real time. By reformulating the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) through theoretical examination, we propose **transmittance fields**, generated at a low cost, as auxiliary information to help the network better approximate the RTE, drastically reducing the size of the neural network. The light weight network efficiently estimates the difficult-to-solve in-scattering term and allows for configurable shading parameters while improving prediction accuracy. In addition, we propose a frequency-sensitive stencil design in order to handle non-cloud shapes, resulting in accurate shadow boundaries. Results show that our MRPNN is able to synthesize indistinguishable output compared to the ground truth. Most importantly, MRPNN achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art, and is able to render high-quality participating material in real time.
